# How to update images on the website?

The most important is to tackle the dimensions and size of the photo.
- Right-click on the image and choose to inspect.
- Inspect window will be open and show the size of the image.
- But for the best, there will be a link given there for a photo, click on that.
- It will open the actual photo in another tab, and when you inspect that one it will show the exact and correct size.
- You can also see the size on the search bar shown at the end of the link of the page.
- For finding photos, use Envato Elements, flickr.com, Canva, or Google but the photo must have a CC license.
