- The Juniors now make 15K/month
- 20K/month
- 20K/month = full time for a junior
- We have a basic package that starts at 11K base
- And if they have perfect attendance, it goes up to 15K.... if they get badges & certifications... it goes up to 19K
- Grade 1 is only 2K base
- Communication is 10x more important than work.
